Preconditions: The SpotzSDK has already been imported


Because we are mixing swift code with objective-c code we need a header file to act as a bridge between the two and import the needed objective-c header files.

In objective-c we would use #import "myfile.h", but in swift imports are done automatically.

To create the bridge file:
1. Create a new header file by going file>new>file>(select header).
2. Name the header file "myProjectName-Bridging-Header.h".
3. Look in the project build settings for "Objective-C Bridging Header" and add the location of your header file.
    This will usually be "myProjectName/myProjectName-Bridging-Header.h".
4. Return to the header file and finally import your objective-c headers (in objective-c),
    e.g. #import <SpotzSDK/SpotzSDK.h>.
5. These will now be accessible from your swift files.
